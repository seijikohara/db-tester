/**
 * Neo4j Graph Database integration tests for Spock.
 *
 * <p>This package demonstrates that DB Tester works with Neo4j, a graph database, using the
 * official Neo4j JDBC driver. Neo4j stores data as nodes and relationships, but the JDBC driver
 * allows querying via Cypher and returns results in tabular format compatible with JDBC
 * ResultSets.
